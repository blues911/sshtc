sshtc

DESCRIPTION

SSH client.
Executes SSH connection in Linux terminal.

Connection modes:
1. password (by default)
2. public key

Note: sshtc uses sshpass to handle ssh password request. This is not safe for a
multi users mode, so use it on your own risk! My purpose was to build simple ssh
client and run away from PuTTY.

DEPENDENCIES

openssh-server
sshpass

INSTALL

git clone https://github.com/smokehill/sshtc.git
