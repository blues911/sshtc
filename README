SSHTC 0.1

DESCRIPTION

Tiny SSH client in Linux terminal.

Connection modes:
1. password (by default)
2. public key

Note: SSHTC uses SSHPass to handle SSH password request. This is not safe for a
multi users mode, so use it on your own risk! My purpose was to build simple SSH
client and run away from PuTTY.

DEPENDENCIES

openssh-server
sshpass

INSTALL
